// You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. You will be given two baskets, 
//and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.

// You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. The farm has following restrictions:
// 1. Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
// 2. You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
// 3. You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.


//input:  an Array of fruits to represent the single row of trees  
// output : maximunm number of fruits yoy have in both baskets 
// R:  cant skip trees, so meaning that it must be concurrant cant skip of a new element to get to the other fruits trees 

//p: implement a hash map with a sliding window Similar to longest concurrent substring fo k values where k is repersented by the baskets.
